# Bitcoin Price tracker

This is a small R script which takes a CSV file with Bitcoin prices and plots Bitcoin Closing prices on a chart. Currently I download a csv file manually from [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD "Link to Yahoo Finance BTC-UST historic prices"). My intention is to get an API to automate this step.

My initial idea was to get a model to attempt to predict the price movement, but I am still looking for a suitable model. I have a module about Regression models in a few weeks at CodeClan, hopefully it will help me choosing the right model.
